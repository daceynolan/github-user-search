# GitHub User Search

### Purpose

This app re-implements a portion of GitHub's search by using the GitHub public API. You can enter a name of the user that you are searching for and will receive a paginated list of results. You can click on a result to jump to their GitHub profile.

### Development Focus

- Implement `TypeScript` to add static type-checking
- Implement `useEffect` hooks to react to data changes
- Create unit tests for components using `Jest` and `React Testing Library`
- Implement pagination with `react-paginate`
- Tailwind for utility styling and responsive layout

### Future Improvements

- Implement more testing to reach 100% test coverage
  - Research mocking API request
- Refactor to use `react-query` for fetching and updating asynchronous data
- Refactor some tests to address this [article](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/common-mistakes-with-react-testing-library)
- Authenticate requests to increase [rate limit](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting) from 60 to 5000 per hour
- Explore using GitHub GraphQL API to add additional information to the user card
- Store query in the URL for deep linking
